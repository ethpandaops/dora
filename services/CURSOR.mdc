Core business logic services that orchestrate data access between blockchain clients, database, and frontend cache.

- ChainService manages consensus/execution client pools for blockchain data retrieval
- FrontendCacheService provides tiered caching with processing coordination
- All services use dependency injection pattern with logger and client pool dependencies
- Implement rate limiting for external API calls to prevent client overload
- Use context-aware operations for cancellation and timeouts
