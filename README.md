## What is this?
This is a lightweight beaconchain explorer.

A Beaconchain explorer is a tool that allows users to view and interact with the data on the Ethereum Beacon Chain. It is similar to a blockchain explorer, which allows users to view data on a blockchain such as the current state of transactions and blocks - but focussed on exploring the beaconchain.

This "lightweight" explorer loads most of the information directly from an underlying standard beacon node api, which makes it a lot easier and cheaper to run (no 3rd party proprietary database like bigtables required).

## Testnet instances
[Hole≈°ky](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) Testnet: 
* https://dora-holesky.pk910.de/
* https://dora.holesky.ethpandaops.io/

[Sepolia](https://github.com/eth-clients/sepolia) Testnet: 
* https://dora.sepolia.ethpandaops.io/

[Ephemery](https://github.com/ephemery-testnet/ephemery-resources) Testnet: 
* https://beaconlight.ephemery.dev/

# Setup & Configuration
Read through the [wiki](https://github.com/ethpandaops/dora/wiki) for setup & configuration instructions.

## Dependencies

The explorer has no mandatory external dependencies. It can even run completely in memory only.\
However, for best performance I recommend using a PostgreSQL database.

# Development Setup

The repository contains a script that simplifies spinning up a development environment for the explorer.

Follow these steps to spin up a full ethereum testnet with the locally build dora instance:

1. Ensure docker & [kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install) are installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `make devnet-run`

The `make devnet-run` command spins up a kurtosis testnet with multiple client pairs. To stop the testnet after development work, run `make devnet-clean`
