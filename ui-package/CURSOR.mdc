Embeddable React UI components for Ethereum staking operations (deposits, withdrawals, consolidations) with Web3 wallet integration.

- All components must be wrapped with WagmiRainbowProvider for Web3 functionality
- Use lazy loading with webpack chunks for component isolation and performance  
- Export components via global namespace (globalThis.doraUiComponents) for embedding
- Maintain stateless design with external configuration via props interfaces
- Components integrate with Go embed.FS for asset serving in parent application
