Ethereum execution layer indexer supporting deposits, withdrawals, and consolidations via generic contract indexing pattern.

- Use generic contractIndexer[TxType] pattern for type-safe transaction processing
- Implement priority-based execution client selection with archive node fallback
- Support fork-aware processing with separate handlers for finalized vs recent transactions
- Always include batch processing with configurable batch sizes for RPC efficiency
- Maintain queue-based dequeue rate calculations for transaction timing predictions
- Use IndexerCtx for centralized client pool and chain state management
