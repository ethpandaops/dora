Ethereum beacon chain indexer that processes data from multiple consensus clients with real-time event processing and comprehensive caching.

- Support multiple consensus clients simultaneously via Client abstraction
- Use layered caching strategy: blockCache, epochCache, forkCache, validatorCache
- Implement memory-bounded design with configurable `inMemoryEpochs` limit
- Process finalization events to persist data and prune old cache entries
- Use background synchronizer for historical data gaps and recovery
- Maintain thread-safe operations with proper mutex protection for concurrent processing
