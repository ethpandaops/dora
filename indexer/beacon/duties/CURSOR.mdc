Implements Ethereum beacon chain validator duty assignments using cryptographic shuffling algorithms.

- Use Fisher-Yates shuffle with deterministic seeding for validator selection
- Support both pre-Electra and Electra fork proposer selection algorithms  
- Maintain cryptographically secure randomness via SHA256 hashing
- Optimize for large validator sets with efficient shuffling algorithms
- Always validate index bounds and handle empty validator lists gracefully
