# Dora Utils

CLI utility collection that provides blockdb synchronization and database migration functionality for Ethereum blockchain data.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Multi-client consensus layer support via connection pooling
- Concurrent slot processing with configurable worker count
- Dynamic SSZ encoding/decoding for Ethereum block data
- Support for multiple storage backends (Pebble, S3) and database engines (SQLite, PostgreSQL)

## Important Constraints
- Always validate epoch ranges before processing (end > start)
- Use connection pooling for high-throughput beacon client operations
- Implement proper error handling with detailed logging for debugging
- Maintain transactional integrity during database migrations
