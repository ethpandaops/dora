Configuration component that embeds default configuration files and validator names using Go's embed package.

- Use Go's `embed` package to bundle configuration files into the binary
- Embed default.config.yml as a string for the main explorer configuration
- Embed *.names.yml files as a filesystem for validator name mappings
- Keep validator name files organized by network (holesky, sepolia, etc.)
- Configuration files should be self-documenting with comments explaining options
