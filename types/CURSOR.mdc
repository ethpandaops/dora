Central type definitions for Dora Ethereum explorer that define configuration, page data, and core domain types.

## Key Patterns
- Configuration structs use yaml and envconfig tags for external configuration
- Use embedded structs to organize related config sections (e.g. Frontend, BeaconApi)  
- All blockchain numeric values use uint64 type for consistency
- Transaction signature types use fixed-size byte arrays and enum-style constants

## Critical Constraints
- Never modify existing struct field names - other components depend on them
- All new config fields must include both yaml and envconfig tags
- Keep type definitions at this level - complex logic belongs in other components
