# Types/Models Component

Data model definitions for Dora Ethereum explorer that serve as the interface between handlers and templates.

## Key Patterns
- All structs follow `*PageData` naming convention for view models
- Use JSON struct tags for frontend serialization
- Include display flags (e.g. `Display*` fields) for UI conditional rendering
- Maintain time.Time for all timestamp fields
- Use uint64 for all blockchain numeric values (slots, epochs, balances)

## Critical Constraints
- Never modify existing JSON field names - frontend depends on them
- All new fields must include appropriate JSON tags
- Display flags must have `dp_` prefix in JSON for consistency
- Client and validator structs must support both execution and consensus layer data
