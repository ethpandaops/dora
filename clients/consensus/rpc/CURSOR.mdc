Ethereum consensus layer RPC client that provides beacon chain API access and real-time event streaming.

- Use go-eth2-client library for all beacon API operations
- Implement concurrent event streaming with proper context cancellation
- Support SSH tunneling for secure remote beacon node connections
- Handle SSZ serialization toggle for client compatibility
- Maintain stateful connections for block/finalization event streams
