Ethereum consensus client pool that manages multiple beacon chain connections with automatic failover and shared chain state.

- Use Pool pattern for managing multiple Client instances with shared ChainState
- Implement subscription-based event dispatching with generic Dispatcher[T] pattern  
- Maintain client health monitoring with automatic retry logic and exponential backoff
- Share finality and chain state updates across all pool clients
- Support client-specific configurations while maintaining pool-level consensus view
