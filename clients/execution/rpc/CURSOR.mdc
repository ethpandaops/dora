# Execution RPC Client

Ethereum execution client RPC interface that provides standardized access to execution layer APIs with SSH tunnel support.

## Key Patterns
- Use ExecutionClient struct as the primary interface for all execution client operations
- Support SSH tunneling for secure remote connections via sshtunnel.SSHTunnel
- Implement client-specific workarounds (e.g., Nethermind admin_peers boolean parameter)
- Maintain dual RPC clients: raw rpc.Client for direct calls, ethclient.Client for standard operations

## Important Constraints
- Always initialize client before use via Initialize() method
- Handle SSH tunnel lifecycle properly - start during construction, cleanup on close
- Support both key-based and password-based SSH authentication
- Implement context-aware operations for all RPC calls
