# Execution Client

Multi-client Ethereum execution layer interface that supports Geth, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon, Reth, and Ethereumjs via connection pooling.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use Pool to manage multiple Client instances with automatic failover
- Support client type detection via version string pattern matching
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed operations
- Maintain shared ChainState across all clients for consistency

## Important Constraints
- Always use pool-based access rather than direct client instantiation
- Implement proper client lifecycle management (online/offline status tracking)
- Support both HTTP and WebSocket connections with SSH tunnel capability
- Maintain backward compatibility across different execution client versions
